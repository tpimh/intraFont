intraFont - A bitmap font library for PSP using the PSP's internal font (firmware pgf files)

intraFont Version 0.1 - Written 2007 by BenHur

intraFont uses parts of pgeFont by InsertWittyName - http://insomniac.0x89.org

-=Info=-

The library loads a pgf font from firmware and generates a 4-bit paletted bitmap font texture on
the fly when drawing text. It caches previously drawn characters and is accurate to 1/4 pixel.

As of version 0.1 intraFont supports regular, italic, and or bold latin and Japanese fonts:
flash0:/font/ltn0.pgf, ltn1.pgf, ..., ltn15.pgf, jpn0.pgf

Planned features for the next version:
- add support for arib.pgf and kr0.pgf (Korean)
- improve INTRAFONT_FIXEDWIDTH (looks crapy)
- implement intraFontMeasureText(), INTRAFONT_VERTADVANCE, INTRAFONT_RIGHTALIGN and INTRAFONT_CENTER
- maybe increase accuracy to 1/64 pixel (at the cost of memory)
- speed & memory optimizations, bug fixes (glyph caching was not extensively tested), cleanup, ...

-=Samples=-

There are two samples included, one for raw GU and the other using the graphics library from
Yeldarb's tutorials on psp-programming.com

If you're using the graphics library then you may need to reset the sceGuTex* states to what
they are defaulted to in the initGraphics() functions, after using the intraFont* functions.

It should be easy enough to add to any other library.

none (i.e. freetype is NOT required)
